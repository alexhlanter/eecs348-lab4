<P>Here is some text about music theory from Wikipedia: Music theory is the study of theoretical 
frameworks for understanding the practices and possibilities of music. The Oxford Companion
to Music describes three interrelated uses of the term "music theory": The first is the "rudiments", 
that are needed to understand music notation (key signatures, time signatures, and rhythmic notation);
the second is learning scholars' views on music from antiquity to the present; the third is a sub-topic of 
musicology that "seeks to define processes and general principles in music". </P>
